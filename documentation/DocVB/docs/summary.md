**This is Our way of solving the Vargi Bot Theme Problem of Eyantra Competition 2020-21**

<h3>hello all, our team is VB#602 and the following is a brief explanation of our task run</h3>

## Our program consists of 2 main nodes:
1.	[node_t5_u1.py](/home/tushar/DocVB/site/node_t5_u1/index.html) - for dispatching
2.	[node_t5_u2.py](/home/tushar/DocVB/site/node_t5_u2/index.html) - for shipping

## Each Node has a different function
	
	The First node deals with eveything on the left side of the task world.
	It extracts the image of package from 2d camera and also uses the UR5_1 arm.

	The Second node deals with everything on the right side of the task world.
	It uses the UR5_2 arm.
